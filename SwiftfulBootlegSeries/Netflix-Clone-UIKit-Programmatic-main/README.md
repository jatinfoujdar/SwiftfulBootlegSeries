# Netflix-Clone-UIKit-Programmatic
Creating a netflix clone application using UIKit fully programmatic

Created a Netflix Clone iOS App using UIKit. 
Used programmatic technique to develop the app, without storyboards. 

The App implements various API Calls to fetch series, various tabs, views like collection view, table view, search view, search results view were implemented to enhance the functionality of the app.

Core data was used to store the downloaded series, and later on fetch the downloaded series data into a table view. This basic demo project helped me to learn about API calls, collection view, search view controller, core data, creating complex UI, and starting working models, decoding JSON and much more.
 
This all helped me to deliver projects for the team with much more grip on development aspects.
